+ not many good **examples** in our world
+ **provider**: college fund
  + always picks up restaurant **bill**
+ **work ethic**: responsible, fulfills promises
+ **faithful**: i.e., doesn't **cheat** on wife
+ mostly about what **not** to do:
  + don't be a **deadbeat**, liar, cheater
  + **stress**: don't **mess up**
+ Ps103 highlights what God **does**
  + as our perfect **Father**
+ **example** for parents to learn from
  + **encouragement** for kids who feel
    the shortcomings of their earthly fathers
+ for **all** of us:
  + take **comfort** knowing God is the God of compassion
  + take **courage** to show compassion to one another
